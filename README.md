# Artificial Neural Network Library
The Artificial Neural Network Library (ANNL) is a C++ open-source project aimed to help on the development of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms. Its flexibility allows the developer to create Neural Networks with any number of layers, add different numbers of neurons at each one, set the weights of the connections and manipulate the output of the algorithm as a simple array.
